# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java 
This repository contains all working algorithms that I have worked. I wish to code almost every algorithm (following all strategies) into this repository.
Ideal use of this is to help someone understand the solutions for algorithmic problems and a cross-reference for me anytime anywhere.

## Dynamic Programming
The **Dynamic Programming** is a algorithmic strategy where the optimal solution for a given problem can be arrived from its overlapping subproblems. It is similar to **Divide and Conquer** strategy in the sense that solution is arrived from subproblems, but varies from it from the fact that the sub problems in dynamic programming are overlapping in nature.

### The Dynamic Programming Problems
1. Fibonacci Numbers - Find out nth Fibonacci number
2. Shortest path from single source to all desinations
3. Coin-Change problem
4.
